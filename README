601.220.05 Intermediate Programming - Final Project

This program implements a maze game in which a Hero tries to escape and avoid 
being captured by the Minotaur. A text file is read from user input to see what 
exact maze the Hero will be placed in to escape from the Minotaur. The Hero wins 
if it is able to get to the goal tile before the Minotaur captures the Hero. The 
Minotaur wins if it is able to capture the Hero. An interesting aspect of this 
game is that some entites may have the 'v' property, meaning that they are 
moveable and can only be pushed onto an unoccupied tile.
